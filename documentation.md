# Project Proposal: "*Elerit Escape*"
## Identifying and Defining
### Identifying a Need:
- '*Elerit Escape*' is a 2D platformer made with Unity which is great entertainment for all ages, requiring careful coordination and a fast reaction time. By making this game, I hope to not only cure the boredom of a wide group of people, but also to give them skills in problem solving, strategic planning, and concentration.
### Requirements Outline:
- Inputs: the user, using 'WASD' or arrow keys, must be able to successful control The Player.
- Processing: the game will first take the player to a splash screen, then a cutscreen, then allow them to go through various different levels. A 'shop' area in the splash screen could also be incorporated.'
- Outputs: the user will be presented with an easy and accessible GUI as well as entertaining and well-drawn graphics for the game.
- Transmission: the game only requires the connection between the game and the singular player.
- Storage: the player's high score, amount of 'coins', and the level the player is up to will be saved locally.
### Functional and Non-Functional Specifications:
- Functional:
    - The game should run smoothly and quickly, with physics which create a good user experience and graphics which make it aesthetically pleasing. The user should be able to pass through the various levels with a relative amount of ease.
    - User Interaction: the user will use either 'WASD' or the arrow keys to move the player through the level. They can also use the cursor to select different items from the shop, enter into the game through the splashscreen, and scroll through the 'help' option.
    - Scoring and Feedback: after each level is completed, there is a 'success' screen an option to either move to the next level, go to the shop, or go to home. 
- Non-Functional:
    - The game should include features such as: a splash screen, a 'help' menu, a pause and mute button, a play button, a quit button, a shop for different upgrades and boosts, and multiple functioning levels.
### Social and Ethical Issues:
- Ethical issues may include whether or not the game is too violent to be suitable for all ages; as it includes zombies. This can easily be solved by ensuring graphics are designed to be safe for children and don't include anything which actually fully fits the somewhat horror-adjacent aspects of the game.
## Researching and Planning
